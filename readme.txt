** If u have any problems with file pathes, here is the link to w3schools with explanation:
https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_filepaths.asp

** the important thing here, is that we are working with document all the time, but on the level of one const - note, where we are creating a html doc.

** working with localstorage:
localStorage.setItem('name', 'Brad');
localStorage.getItem('name');
localStorage.removeItem('name');
it must be always a string, so we can use a method called: JSON.stringify(...)
